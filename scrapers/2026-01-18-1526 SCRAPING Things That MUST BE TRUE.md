SCRAPING THINGS THAT MUST BE TRUE
1) We look at all the places on a website where we might find restrictions;
>>> WE ARE HERE, RUNNING ORGS WITH A REVISED SCANNER.  When the code is ready, we need to ensure it gets into:
     ConOp 
     org-scanner.js
     discover-orgs-by-events.js
     scan-and-scrape-all-live-orgs.js

     * TOU and Variants with all web suffixes/extensions

     * Privacy Policy

     * User Agreement

     * Other

2) We look for the best terms/phrases/concepts we use to identify potential restrictions on each page we find in #1;

3) We interpret those potential restrictions.  We control for false positive, variants from what we have seen before;

4) We update records properly and save the complete sentence/phase of the restriction we found for human review when needed;

5) We maintain an audit log of scans and scan/scrape results so we can see when something changes and do not over wright earlier findings

6) We improve scanning and scanning/scraping based on what we learned (new org paths, new org phrasing)

7) We keep the Scanner and Scanner/Scraper files in sync so the functionality is the same

8) We keep the ConOp and the Scanner and Scanner/Scraper files in sync 

9) Make sure we find the right Home page for an Org, even if we find the Org from an event page

>>> NEED TO IDENTIFY DUPE ORGS when they come in and Merge Events and ORGS
