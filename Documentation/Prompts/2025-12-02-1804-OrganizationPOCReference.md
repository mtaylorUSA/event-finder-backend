## Sample Permission Request Email

```
Subject: Permission Request - Event Data Aggregation for Personal Research Tool

Dear [Name/Team],

I am developing a personal research tool to aggregate publicly available event information from national security and foreign policy organizations. The purpose is to create a consolidated calendar for my own use in tracking relevant events in the defense and intelligence community.

I am writing to request permission to:
1. Programmatically access your public events page
2. Extract basic event information (title, date, time, location, registration URL)
3. Store this information in a personal database
4. Potentially display event titles with links back to your original event pages

I want to emphasize:
- This is currently a personal/research project, not a commercial venture
- All event details would link back to your website for registration
- No content beyond basic event metadata would be reproduced
- I would respect any rate limits or technical restrictions you specify
- I would immediately cease if you prefer I not include your organization

I have reviewed your website's terms of use and wanted to explicitly request permission rather than make assumptions.

Would you be willing to grant permission for this use? I'm happy to provide additional details or discuss any concerns you may have.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
[Your Email]
```
