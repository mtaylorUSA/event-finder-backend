New Chat Background Prompt

* My Preferences for Claude Interactions *
** Always provide step-by-step instructions, including Names of the platform (e.g., Firefox or Powershell)  Name of App or tool (e.g., Pocketbase)  specific action to perform (e.g., "click the sprocket icon")
** Ask me what I should see after each command/step.
** Prompt me to paste what I see after each step.
** Use clear visual formatting with emojis (✅ ❌ 📊 💾 📡 ⚠️)
** Console output should follow pattern: `\\\[Emoji] \\\[Action] \\\[Target]...`
Example: `📡 Fetching: https://example.com`
** Use separators like `────────────────` between major sections
** Provide structured explanations with headers (##) and bullet points
** Show progress/counts in output: `💾 Saved 5 new events`
** Include both high-level summaries AND technical details
** When showing code, explain what it does before/after the code block
** Never ask me to render API Keys in ways that are not secure
** Highlight potential legal, ethical risks as necessary, such as legal risks of scraping websites.
** Prompt me periodically to generate and update user agreements/terms of use, program documentation, etc.
** Experience: Beginner

* Event Finder – Business Objectives and Parameters *
** Build an automated system (app and website) to:
*** Scrape and aggregate national security, defense, and intelligence community events from multiple sources
*** Use AI to continuously discover new event sources based on previous AI-generated results.
*** Automate every step of the process to the greatest extent possible.
*** Minimize costs
*** Before scraping a new organization, check its terms of use and identify if it prohibits scraping. If it does, DO NOT SCRAPE and notify me.
*** OpenAI organizations have been removed from database (November 21, 2025)

* Event Finder - Project Implementation And Status *
** Phase 1: Proof of Concept / MVP Phase:
*** We are in exploratory/proof of concept phase. This project may or may not lead to a commercial platform with subscriptions/advertisements to cover costs.
*** Database: Done.
*** Scrapers: Need to be reactivated one by one as source organizations grant permission
*** AI Embeddings: Need to be re-tested
*** Automation: Needs to be reactivated and tested
*** Workflow ***
**** Daily Automated: GitHub Actions → Run scrapers → Add events to PocketBase → Generate embeddings
**** Manual (Admin): Open admin-interface.html → Login → Discover/Add orgs → Approve → Events auto-scraped next day
**** Analyzes existing organizations and events in database
**** API suggests 20 similar national security/defense organizations
**** Presents suggestions with: name, website, similarity score, 2 sample events, reasoning
**** Admin reviews and approves/rejects organizations (not individual events)
**** Approved organizations added to database with one click
**** Next daily scraper run automatically collects all events from approved organizations

*** Current Status of Scrapers (as of November 21, 2025) ***
**** ALL SCRAPERS ARE DISABLED - No automated scraping is running
**** GitHub Actions workflow "Scrape Events Daily" - DISABLED
**** Windows Task Scheduler tasks - BOTH DISABLED:
***** "Conference Finder Agent" (10:11 AM daily) - DISABLED
***** "Finder Agent" (12:01 PM daily) - DISABLED
**** Legal consultation recommended before any scraping resumes
**** Zero scraping happening anywhere (verified November 21, 2025)

*** Scraper Architecture ***
**** Universal base-scraper.js: Works for ANY organization
***** Uses common HTML patterns to find events
***** Tries multiple selectors automatically
***** No custom code needed per organization
**** Master script: scrape-all-organizations.js
***** Fetches ALL organizations from PocketBase
***** Loops through and scrapes each one
***** 2-second delay between organizations (polite scraping)
**** Scrapers deduplicate events before saving (checks title + start_date)

*** Legal & Compliance Status ***
**** Current Status: ZERO LEGAL RISK
***** All scraping disabled (November 21, 2025)
***** No automated processes running
***** GitHub Actions: Disabled
***** Task Scheduler: Disabled
***** Railway: No scraper deployments active

**** Risk Assessment by Source Type:
***** Think Tanks & Nonprofits (13 orgs): LOW RISK - Will seek permission
****** Nonprofit public service mission
****** Want events publicized (share on LinkedIn/social media)
****** Event data mostly factual (not copyrightable)
****** No ToS prohibitions found
****** Regularly repost events themselves

***** Government (CISA): VERY LOW RISK
****** Government work is public domain
****** Federal websites generally permissive
****** Check specific terms to be safe

***** OpenAI (REMOVED): Was HIGH RISK - Now excluded
****** For-profit tech company
****** Explicit ToS prohibiting automated extraction
****** Active bot protection
****** Decision: NOT WORTH IT - removed from database (Nov 21, 2025)

**** Permission Strategy:
***** Approach: Personal email from YOU (not lawyer initially)
***** Transparency: Mention potential monetization (subscriptions/ads to cover costs)
***** Emphasis: Mutual benefit (drive attendance, free promotion)
***** Expected outcomes:
****** 30-40% explicit "yes"
****** 10-20% "yes with conditions"
****** 30-40% no response (proceed cautiously after documenting good faith effort)
****** 5-10% explicit "no" (exclude them)
***** Lawyer consultation: Only if needed for negotiations or terms of service

*** Immediate Next Steps ***
**** Week of November 25, 2025:
***** ✅ Research contact emails for ALL 14 organizations
***** ✅ Draft customized permission emails
****** Personal email from YOU (not lawyer)
****** Transparent about potential monetization
****** Emphasize mutual benefit
***** ✅ Send permission requests to all 14 organizations

**** December 2025:
***** ⏸️ Wait for responses (2-4 weeks)
***** 📧 Follow up once after 2 weeks if no response
***** 📊 Track all responses in spreadsheet

**** January 2026:
***** ✅ Re-enable scrapers ONLY for organizations that approve
***** ❌ Exclude organizations that explicitly decline
***** ⚠️ Consult lawyer if:
****** Need to negotiate conditions
****** Want to proceed with non-responders
****** Ready to monetize
****** Need terms of service drafted for YOUR platform

**** Technical Challenges:
***** Date/Time format complexity across different websites
***** Preserve timezone: America/New_York
***** Generic scraper may not work for all organizations (some may need custom scrapers)

** Phase 2: Develop Frontend and Features **
*** Enable email notifications
*** Enable calendar integrations (Outlook, Google calendar, iCal, etc)
*** Enable advanced filtering (e.g. user location, proximity, topic)
*** Enable user search interface with AI-powered recommendations

** Phase 3: Expand User Base **
*** Develop user subscriptions with database management, security, etc.

** Phase 4 (Possible - Assess Viability First) **
*** Assess business viability
*** Enable paid subscriptions
*** Enable advertising

** Commercial Viability Reality Check **
*** Current Assessment: Probably NOT viable as major business
**** Small niche: ~5,000 potential users (national security professionals in DC area)
**** Realistic paying users: 20-100 max
**** Revenue potential: $1,200-12,000/year
**** Licensing costs (if required): $5,000-15,000/year
**** Result: Likely loses money OR barely breaks even

*** Recommended Approach:
**** Phase 1: Personal Tool (2025-2026)
***** Keep it free
***** Use for yourself
***** Share with 10-20 colleagues
***** Zero monetization = lower legal risk
***** Build and refine the tool

**** Phase 2: Public Free Service (2026)
***** Make publicly available
***** Still free (no subscriptions/ads)
***** Build user base organically
***** Assess actual demand and usage
***** Get user feedback

**** Phase 3: Assess Viability (Late 2026)
***** If 100+ active users who love it
***** If clear willingness to pay
***** If revenue >$50k/year seems realistic
***** THEN consider monetization

**** Phase 4: Monetize (Maybe 2027+)
***** Only if Phase 3 shows strong demand
***** Get formal licensing agreements with all sources
***** Hire lawyer for proper terms of service
***** Incorporate as business (LLC or C-Corp)
***** Implement payment processing
***** Professional infrastructure

*** Permission Request Transparency:
**** Be honest: "Personal project that may have modest subscriptions/ads to cover costs"
**** Don't oversell: NOT "building a major business"
**** Honesty increases likelihood of approval
**** Most nonprofits will appreciate transparency
