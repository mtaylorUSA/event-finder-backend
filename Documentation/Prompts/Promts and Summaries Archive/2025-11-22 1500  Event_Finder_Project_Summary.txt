Event Finder Project Summary
Updated: November 21, 2025
My Preferences for Claude Interactions
• Always provide step-by-step instructions
• Always provide complete updates/files (i.e., do not provide line by line edits to existing files)
• Always provide directions by telling me:
 * The platform I am to use (e.g., Firefox, Powershell)
 * The app or document I am to use (e.g., PocketBase)
 * The specific steps I am supposed to take
 * always provide each command separately (not in one window), so I can copy/paste each command prompt
• Ask what I should see after each command/step
• Use clear visual formatting with emojis
• Include high-level summaries for steps
• Highlight potential legal and ethical risks
• Experience Level: Beginner
• Generate java script, not Python

Event Finder - Business Objectives
Build an automated system to:
• Scrape and aggregate national security, defense, and intelligence community events
• Use AI to discover new event sources
• Automate every step of the process
• Minimize costs
• OpenAI organizations removed from database (November 21, 2025)

Project Implementation Status
Phase 1: Proof of Concept / MVP
Currently in exploratory phase. May lead to commercial platform with subscriptions/advertisements.
• Database: Done
• Scrapers: Need reactivation after permission granted
• AI Embeddings: Need re-testing
• Automation: Needs reactivation and testing
Current Status of Scrapers (November 21, 2025)
• ALL SCRAPERS DISABLED - No automated scraping running
• GitHub Actions: DISABLED
• Windows Task Scheduler: Both tasks DISABLED
? "Conference Finder Agent" (10:11 AM) - DISABLED
? "Finder Agent" (12:01 PM) - DISABLED
• Zero scraping happening anywhere

• Atlantic Council - Nonprofit
• Brookings Institution - Nonprofit
• Council on Foreign Relations - Nonprofit
• CNAS (Center for a New American Security) - Nonprofit

Legal & Compliance Status
Current Status: ZERO LEGAL RISK
• All scraping disabled (November 21, 2025)
• No automated processes running
• GitHub Actions: Disabled
• Task Scheduler: Disabled
• Railway: No scraper deployments active
Risk Assessment by Organization Type
Think Tanks & Nonprofits (13 orgs): LOW RISK
• Nonprofit public service mission
• Want events publicized (share on social media)
• Event data mostly factual (not copyrightable)
• No Terms of Service prohibitions found
Government (CISA): VERY LOW RISK
• Government work is public domain
• Federal websites generally permissive
OpenAI: EXCLUDED (Removed from Database)
• For-profit tech company with explicit ToS prohibiting scraping
• Active bot protection
• Decision: Not worth the legal risk - excluded


Permission Request Strategy
• Approach: Personal email (not lawyer initially)
• Transparency: Mention potential monetization to cover costs
• Emphasis: Mutual benefit (drive attendance, free promotion)
Expected Outcomes
• 30-40% explicit approval
• 10-20% approval with conditions
• 30-40% no response
• 5-10% explicit decline
Immediate Next Steps
Week of November 25, 2025
• Research contact emails for all 14 organizations
• Draft customized permission emails
• Send permission requests
December 2025
• Wait for responses (2-4 weeks)
• Follow up after 2 weeks if no response
• Track all responses
January 2026
• Re-enable scrapers ONLY for approved organizations
• Exclude organizations that decline
• Consult lawyer if needed for negotiations


Technical Architecture
Backend: PocketBase (SQLite)
• Hosted on Railway
• Stores events from 14 organizations
• Collections: organizations, events, event_embeddings
Scraper Architecture
• Universal scraper (base-scraper.js): Works for any organization
• Master script (scrape-all-organizations.js): Processes all orgs
• 2-second delay between organizations (polite scraping)
• Automatic deduplication
Development Tools
• PowerShell (Windows command line)
• Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
• GitHub for version control
• Axios + Cheerio for web scraping

Commercial Viability Assessment
Recommended Phased Approach
Phase 1: Personal Tool (2025-2026)
• Keep it free
• Use for yourself
• Share with 10-20 colleagues
• Zero monetization = lower legal risk
Phase 2: Public Free Service (2026)
• Make publicly available
• Still free (no subscriptions/ads)
• Build user base
• Assess actual demand
Phase 3: Assess Viability (Late 2026)
• If 100+ active users who love it
• If clear willingness to pay
• If revenue >$50k/year realistic
• THEN consider monetization
Phase 4: Monetize (Maybe 2027+)
• Only if Phase 3 shows strong demand
• Get formal licensing agreements
• Hire lawyer for terms of service
• Incorporate as business
