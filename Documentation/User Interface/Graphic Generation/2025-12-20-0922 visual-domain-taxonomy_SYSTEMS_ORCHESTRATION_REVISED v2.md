# VISUAL DOMAIN: SYSTEMS / ORCHESTRATION

---

## DOMAIN INTENT
     * Represent **coordination, control, dependency, and flow** across complex systems.
     * Convey how multiple components interact without depicting:
          ** Individual actors
          ** Command authority figures
          ** Real control rooms or dashboards
     * Emphasize **structure over agency** and **process over decision-makers**.

---

## CORE CONCEPTUAL THEMES
     * Distributed coordination
     * Interconnected subsystems
     * Sequencing and dependency
     * Signal flow and routing
     * Emergent order without centralized control

---

## PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT RULES
     * Environments are:
          ** Modern, "Digital Age" aesthetic
          ** Architectural
          ** Diagrammatic-in-spirit

     * Common spatial metaphors:
          ** Layered planes
          ** Interlocking pathways
          ** Grids, lattices, or networks
          ** Modular compartments or zones

     * Perspective is:
          ** Elevated or orthographic
          ** Non-human
          ** Detached from scale realism

---

## ALLOWED VISUAL METAPHORS
     * Flowing lines or channels representing information, logistics, or energy
     * Interlocking geometric forms indicating dependency
     * Rhythmic repetition to suggest process automation
     * Light or tonal gradients indicating activation or prioritization
     * Directionality implied through composition, not arrows
     * Screens, dashboards, terminals, or UI elements
     * Control rooms, war rooms, command centers


---

## DISALLOWED REPRESENTATIONS
     * ❌ Human operators or silhouettes
     * ❌ Literal maps with borders, labels, or coordinates
     * ❌ Arrows, flowcharts, or explicit diagram symbols

---

## AESTHETIC CONSTRAINTS
     * Color palettes are:
          ** Functional
          ** Hierarchical (foreground vs background clarity)
     * Visual clarity preferred over density
     * Motion implied through repetition or flow — never chaos


---


## SYMBOLIC ICONOGRAPHY RULES
     * Icon usage:
          ** Zero or one explicit symbolic icon maximum
     * Preferred approach:
          ** No explicit icons
          ** Meaning carried through structure alone
     * If an icon is used:
          ** It must be abstract (e.g., node, junction, conduit)
          ** It must not dominate the frame

---

## SCALE & ABSTRACTION
     * Scale is intentionally ambiguous
     * Systems may appear:
          ** Too large to be human-scale
          ** Too small to be mechanical-scale
     * Avoid cues that anchor the viewer to:
          ** A room
          ** A building
          ** A specific technology generation


---


## RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER DOMAINS
     * Frequently used as:
          ** Secondary domain
          ** Overlay domain
     * Interactions:
          ** GOVERNANCE: Systems appear regulated, bounded, or constrained
          ** ECOLOGICAL: Systems appear adaptive, cyclical, or organic
          ** INFRASTRUCTURE (future): Systems appear engineered but impersonal
     * Never overrides the primary domain’s physical world


---


## FAILURE MODES TO AVOID
     * Accidental depiction of decision authority
     * Visual resemblance to software UI
     * Excessive density that collapses abstraction
     * Turning “systems” into “machines with operators”


---


## DOMAIN SUMMARY (ONE-LINE)
     * **SYSTEMS / ORCHESTRATION** visualizes how complex processes coordinate and flow — without showing who controls them or how decisions are made.
