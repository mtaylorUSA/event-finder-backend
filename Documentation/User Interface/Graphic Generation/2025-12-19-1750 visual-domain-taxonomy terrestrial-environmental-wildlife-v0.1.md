# Visual Domain Taxonomy v0.1
## Domain: TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL
## Modifier: Wildlife

---

## Purpose
     * This document defines the **TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL** visual domain with the **Wildlife modifier enabled**.
     * It constrains how environmental and climate-related topics may be visually represented when animal life is a relevant component.
     * All content is proprietary and subject to the project owner’s copyright.

---

## Core Principles (Domain + Modifier)
     * Environmental context takes precedence over individual subjects.
     * Wildlife is depicted as part of broader ecosystems, not as focal mascots.
     * Imagery must remain grounded, terrestrial, and naturalistic.
     * Editorial tone over emotional or sentimental framing.

## Domain Definition: TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL

### **Use When**
     * Climate change
     * Natural resources
     * Energy transition
     * Environmental risk
     * Biodiversity loss or ecosystem disruption (explicitly specified)

---

### **Visual Language**
     * Atmosphere, sky, land, water, terrain
     * Earth viewed from within atmosphere or as background context
     * Sunlight, haze, smoke, weather systems
     * Industrial elements integrated into natural landscapes
     * Ecological balance or imbalance conveyed through environment

     * **When Wildlife Modifier Is Enabled**
          ** Animals appear within natural habitats
          ** Scale reflects real-world proportions
          ** Behavior is naturalistic and non-anthropomorphic
          ** Wildlife presence supports the environmental narrative

---

### **Allowed Abstractions**
     * Luminous continent outlines
     * Latitude / longitude lines
     * Airflow, heat, and emissions represented as terrestrial flows
     * Environmental gradients (heat, drought, flooding, deforestation)

     * **With Wildlife Modifier**
          ** Animal silhouettes or realistic forms
          ** Migration paths or habitat ranges
          ** Predator–prey or ecosystem relationships
          ** Subtle emphasis on species interdependence

---

### **Explicit Exclusions**
     * ❌ Space, stars, galaxies, nebulae
     * ❌ Orbits, halos, planetary rings
     * ❌ Deep-space gradients or cosmic voids
     * ❌ Anthropomorphized animals
     * ❌ Cartoon, mascot, or sentimental wildlife depictions
     * ❌ Isolated animal portraits disconnected from ecosystem context

---

### **Defaults**
     * Density: Low–Medium
     * Contrast: Medium–High (natural lighting contrast)
     * Color Bias: Earth tones with atmospheric variation
     * Humans: None

---

## Modifier Notes: Wildlife
     * Wildlife must never become the sole narrative focus.
     * Animals should reinforce environmental stakes, not replace them.
     * Avoid charismatic-species bias unless the topic explicitly requires it.
     * Favor ecological systems over individual species.

---

## Global Cross-Domain Rules (Inherited)
     * One dominant metaphor per image
     * Secondary elements must be atmospheric
     * No readable text
     * No named U.S. politicians
     * No U.S. political parties
     * Ethical, non-graphic, non-sensational imagery only
