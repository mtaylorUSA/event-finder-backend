# Visual Domain Taxonomy v0.1 (Governance Overlay)

     * Primary Domain: TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL
          ** Modifier: Wildlife / Fish (optional)
     * Secondary Domain: INSTITUTIONAL / GOVERNANCE (Iconography Overlay Only)

---

# Purpose
     * This document defines how **INSTITUTIONAL / GOVERNANCE** iconography is applied as a **secondary overlay** on a **TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL** primary domain.
     * Governance is expressed through **subtle, background iconography** rather than spatial framing or physical containment.
     * This approach preserves environmental dominance while ensuring governance is legible at editorial and thumbnail scales.
     * All content is proprietary and subject to the project owner’s copyright.

# Core Principles (Overlay Model)
     * The primary domain defines the physical environment.
     * Governance does not alter or contain the environment.
     * Governance presence is contextual, symbolic, and recessed.
     * Iconography must be recognizable but non-dominant.
     * Avoid theatrical, political, or event-based imagery.

# Governance Overlay Definition: INSTITUTIONAL / GOVERNANCE

     * Use When
          ** Policy, negotiation, or governance is relevant but not the primary subject
          ** Topics such as climate negotiations, AI governance, trade regimes, or norms
          ** Institutional influence should be implied rather than depicted directly

# Governance Visual Language (Overlay Only)

     ** Allowed Forms
          *** Generic institutional architecture silhouettes (non-identifiable)
          *** Abstract civic forms (chambers, assemblies, council geometries)
          *** Symbolic governance motifs rendered as haze, shadow, or reflection
          *** Double-exposure or ghosted background layers

     ** Rendering Characteristics
          *** Low opacity and low contrast
          *** Background placement only
          *** Atmospheric integration (fog, haze, shadow)
          *** Recognizable on second glance, not immediate focus

# Explicit Constraints (Critical)

     * ❌ No spatial framing or environmental containment
     * ❌ No architectural enclosure of the primary scene
     * ❌ No foreground governance elements
     * ❌ No people, leaders, delegates, or crowds
     * ❌ No flags, insignia, or national symbols (unless explicitly required by topic)
     * ❌ No readable text or signage
     * ❌ No UI frames, borders, or infographic overlays

---

# Relationship to Primary Domain

     * Governance iconography must never compete with the primary domain.
     * Environmental elements must remain visually dominant.
     * Governance serves as contextual background, not narrative driver.
     * If governance becomes visually dominant, reduce opacity or scale until secondary.

---

# Defaults (Overlay Behavior)

     * Opacity: Low
     * Contrast: Low–Medium
     * Depth: Background only
     * Scale: Large but faint (silhouette logic)
     * Humans: None

---

# Inherited Global Rules

     * One dominant metaphor per image
     * Secondary elements must remain atmospheric
     * No named U.S. politicians
     * No U.S. political parties
     * No violence, no weapons, no graphic content
     * Ethical, non-sensational imagery only

---

# Intent Summary
     * Governance should be **legible, not literal**
     * Institutions should feel **present, not staged**
     * The image should read as *environment first, governance second*
     * If reduced to thumbnail size, governance remains detectable without overpowering the scene
