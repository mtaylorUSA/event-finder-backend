# Visual Domain Taxonomy v0.1
     * Domain: TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL
          ** Modifier: Wildlife

---

# Purpose
     * This document defines the **TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL** visual domain with the **Wildlife modifier enabled**.
     * It constrains how environmental and climate-related topics may be visually represented, to include when animal life is a relevant component.
     * All content is proprietary and subject to the project owner’s copyright.

---

# Core Principles (Domain + Modifier)
     * Environmental context takes precedence over individual subjects.
     * Wildlife is depicted as part of broader ecosystems, not as focal mascots.
     * Imagery must remain grounded, terrestrial, and ecologically grounded.
     * Editorial tone over emotional or sentimental framing.

# Domain Definition: TERRESTRIAL / ENVIRONMENTAL

     * Use When
          ** Climate change
          ** Natural resources
          ** Energy transition
          ** Environmental risk
          ** Biodiversity loss or ecosystem disruption (explicitly specified)

---

# Visual Language
     * Base Environmental Visual Language (applies unless modified below)
          ** Atmosphere, sky, land, water, terrain
          ** Earth viewed from within atmosphere or as background context
          ** Sunlight, haze, smoke, weather systems
          ** Industrial elements integrated into natural landscapes
          ** Ecological balance or imbalance conveyed through environment

          ** When Wildlife Modifier Is Enabled
               *** Animals appear within natural habitats
               *** Scale reflects real-world proportions
               *** Behavior is non-anthropomorphic
               *** Wildlife presence supports the environmental narrative

          ** When Fish or Fishery Modifier Is Enabled
               *** Aquatic environments only (rivers, oceans, lakes)
               *** Subsurface lighting, depth, and water-column effects
               *** Schools, migration, spawning, or habitat presence

# Allowed Abstractions
     * Luminous continent outlines
     * Latitude / longitude lines
     * Airflow, heat, and emissions represented as terrestrial flows
     * Environmental gradients (heat, drought, flooding, deforestation)

     * With Wildlife Modifier
          ** Simplified, symbolic, or stylized animal forms
          ** Migration paths or habitat ranges
          ** Predator–prey or ecosystem relationships
          ** Subtle emphasis on species interdependence

     * With Fish or Fishery Modifier
          ** Stylized aquatic animal forms
          ** Migration routes or spawning pathways
          ** Food-chain, reef, or marine ecosystem relationships

# Explicit Exclusions
     * ❌ Space, stars, galaxies, nebulae
     * ❌ Orbits, halos, planetary rings
     * ❌ Deep-space gradients or cosmic voids
     * ❌ Anthropomorphized animals
     * ❌ Cartoon, mascot, or sentimental wildlife depictions
     * ❌ Isolated animal portraits disconnected from ecosystem context
     * ❌ Photorealistic or documentary-style animal depictions

---

# Defaults
     * Density: Low–Medium
     * Contrast: Medium–High (natural lighting contrast)
     * Color Bias: Earth tones with atmospheric variation
     * Humans: None

---

# Modifier Notes: Wildlife
     * Wildlife must never become the sole narrative focus.
     * Animals should reinforce environmental stakes, not replace them.
     * Avoid charismatic-species bias unless the topic explicitly requires it.
     * Avoid single-animal dominance; compositions should reflect ecosystems, not individuals.
     * Favor ecological systems over individual species.

---

# Global Cross-Domain Rules (Inherited)
     * One dominant metaphor per image
     * Secondary elements must be atmospheric
     * No readable text
     * No named U.S. politicians
     * No U.S. political parties
     * Ethical, non-graphic, non-sensational imagery only
