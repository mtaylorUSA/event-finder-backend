Dear [POC_NAME],

I am developing a research tool to aggregate publicly available event information from national security and foreign policy organizations. I am writing to request permission to:
- Programmatically access your public events list page and/or individual events' pages;
- Extract basic event information (title, date, time, location, URL);
- Store this information in a personal database;
- Display event titles with links back to your original event pages.

I want to emphasize:
- This is currently a personal/research project, intended for me and a small number of users;
- All events would link back to your website for registration;
- No content beyond basic event metadata would be reproduced;
- I would respect any rate limits or technical restrictions;
- I would immediately cease if requested.

I have reviewed your website's terms of use and wanted to explicitly request permission rather than make assumptions.

Would you be willing to grant permission for this use?

Thank you for your consideration.

Regards,
