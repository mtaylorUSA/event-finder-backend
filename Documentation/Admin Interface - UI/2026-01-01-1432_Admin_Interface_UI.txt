# Admin Interface

I would like to update the admin interface to facilitate navigation and workflow.  Let's do this:


-----
 

# Add a Tab called "Organization By Status." This tab page shows links to lists based on the status of the Organization.  Links are as follows:

     * Nominated/Pending Mission Review: 0  <-- Make this a link to a list of any organizations that are pending mission review

     * Mission Approved/Pending Permission: 4  <-- Make this a link to a page with a list of any organizations that are pending Permission,  I think this would essentially be the "Permission Requests" tab content
          ** Destination Page has a sortable list
          ** Each Organization entry has these items:
               ** Organization - Link to the Organization's Profile Page
               ** Website Link
               ** Warnings or Alerts
               ** email address(es)

               ** "Edit Draft" button
               ** Add POC Info button
               ** "Change Status" Dropdown <-- Allows me to change the status to any of our defined statuses.


     * Permission Requested: 13 <-- Make this a link to a page with a list of any organizations that are Permission Requested.  On the destination page, it shows organizations requested by Self or requested by Lawyer.
          ** Destination Page has a sortable list
          ** Each Organization entry has these items:
