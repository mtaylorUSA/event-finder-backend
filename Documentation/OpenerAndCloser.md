EVENT FINDER

OPENER

I'm working on Event Finder project to improve XYZXYZXYZ.



Please find the attached ConOp for the Event Finder Project. It is long, so please:

1\) scan the Table of Contents to understand the structure

2\) read the following sections carefully:

&nbsp;    \* XYXYXYXYX

&nbsp;    \* XYXYXYXYX



Other attachments include:

&nbsp;    \* XYXYXYXYX

     \* XYXYXYXYX



Please let me know if you need other information or files.

CLOSER

The ConOp is huge and requires a lot of compute to update, so I propose:

1\) Only update the Org discovery sections of the ConOp if the update from 18 to 20 is essential to Claude working scanning in the future.  If not, leave it out.



2\) Add the Contact repairs (the "faucet") to the ConOp, especially in the handoff section so we can jump on it tomorrow.



Please do not truncate the doc or delete sections unrelated to our work today.  Please respect formatting.
